# Week #6 Reflection
This week was spent learning about coding in HTML!

## HTML CODING

This is what I made using HTML in P5js this week, following along with Abram's instructions: [html practice - guitar tab](https://editor.p5js.org/tanwat27/sketches/T4X8a5ema)

I made this by following along with the poetry page exercise we did on Thursday. I'm not the biggest poetry person, so instead I decided to code a guitar tab! I'm glad Abram mentioned monospaced lettering because it came in handy for this, had I not thought of it, the lines of the tab would all be slightly misaligned. Using a monospaced type made it so that everything lined up nicely.

I really like HTML! It seems way simpler than Javascript (at least, so far...). This was super easy to pull off, and I've written guitar tabs with pen and paper before, and I can honestly say I might use this in the future again because it worked so well.

I wish I could have gotten more done this week, but unfortunately I caught COVID in The Big 2026, and I was honestly struggling to keep up with the lectures. On a similar note, I apologize for this reflection being a day late, it's been a rough week!
