# Week #1 Reflection:

This week in CT 20 was full of reading and experimenting. I really enjoyed the introduction to Coding as Creative Medium, mostly because I was really intimidated by this class because I have no little to no prior experience with coding. From my understanding, Code as Creative Medium is going to drive the curriculum of this course, and my nerves were eased by how the introduction hammers down on how we need more education in coding as an art form, and how not everything has to be about the nitty-gritty science of coding. I would love to be able to use code as a tool within my art praxis, and I think this course is going to help lay the foundation for that without expecting me to be an expert at it. Similarly, reading Dorothy Santos' take on learning how to code also gave me confidence, because she explained how there is so much information out there and resources are available if you are serious about seeking them out and applying them to your work.

We started out in p5js this week too, and I was having some fun and frustration with that. I spent some time on the site going through the list of references, and sort of categorizing them in my head as tools. As I looked into all the functions, I was taking note of which ones could be interchangeable. For example, I figured out how to make  a perfect or oblong circle using the arc function and not the circle one. The thing I am having the most trouble with right now is the positioning of everything on the canvas space. It takes so much trial and error to get what I want where I want it to be. I haven't been trying to make anything too technical with the functions, but I don't 100% understand all the positioning parameters yet, or even positioning with the simplest of parameters. But I'm trying to get there.

My next steps are to keep experimenting, and decide soon what project I am going to pursue first for the class.
