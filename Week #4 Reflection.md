# Week #4 Reflection
This week, I worked with Blender alongside our TA in class, and worked on my iterative pattern project in P5js.

## Blender

I had a lot of funwith the work we did in Blender! I have worked with Blender before, but I had never touched the console. I was only making shapes within the 3D space. Using the console was definetly difficult, at least for me. There seems to be a lot of commands to get used to, and I'm not totally there yet. However, I found it somewhat easy to debug as I went along with Lily's instructions, and by the end I was catching her mistakes before she did. I was also one of the lucky few who were able to get the Blender code to render in P5js on Thursday, so that felt pretty gratifying. I am curious if you're able to build shapes in Blender outside of the console, just using their shape tools and stuff, and then somehow load those into P5js without building everything within the Blender console? I'll have to look into that!

## P5js - Iterative Pattern Project
For my iterative pattern, I wanted to do something simple and geometric, but that still had a fair amount of detail. I knew I wanted to use a color filled star within my pattern, and that was the first area where I struggled. I tried building it out with lines, but then I wasn't able to fill it! So I took to YouTube. I found a video from the creator Co-Dart that explained how to use math to make a star. I followed along with the video, and changed some parameters to fit my needs. In the end, I had a red star placed in the center of the base of my pattern. Then, I was able to start tackling the more straight forward parts of the project.
I wanted the base pattern to create shapes by being repeated, so I took to the corners and edges of the pattern area. In each corner, I placed arcs filled with blue so that when the patter repeated the arcs would take the shape of a blue circle. Then, in the center of each edge, I placed a small triangle, so that when the pattern repeats I get perpendicular diamonds on the pattern. I set the background to be a nuetral off-white/beige color, the star to be a deep red, the circles to be blue, and the triangles to be dark green. For the traingles, I had to set the shape to noFill(), and then create individual lines on the areas that needed to be outlined. If I had just given the triangles a stroke around them, there would be a line going down the middle of each triangle, which I did not want.
Then I needed to know how to get the pattern to repeat. I found a great video from Jeff Thompson on YouTube titled CP1: Iteration && Loops in P5JS - 2D Iteration. Within just the first couple of minutes, he showed how to make a grid using nested for loops. Instead of having it draw a grid with rectangles/squared, I had it call a "drawPattern" function. Then, in my original design of the base pattern, I added x + and y +  to all of my coordinate positions, so that in the nested for loops it would use x and y to repeat the pattern all over the canvas. In the end, it all worked how I wanted it to, and I had my cool pattern!
Overall, this project really helped me internalize the positioning mechanics of P5js. I had a rocky start with them, but now I feel like I have them nailed down, and my next couple of projects should go smoothly!
